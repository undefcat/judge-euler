# Digit cancelling fractions

## Problem

The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

## Solution

- 분자, 분모를 10~99사이로 생성한다.
- 생성한 수를 나눈 수와 분자의 1의자리/분모의 10의자리를 제거한 수를 나눈 뒤 비교한다.
- 같은 경우만 모은 뒤 답을 구한다.
